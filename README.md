# Build-it-bigger: A project to learn more about android gradle and flavors

In this project, you will create an app with multiple flavors that uses
multiple libraries and Google Cloud Endpoints. The finished app will consist
of four modules. A Java library that provides jokes, a Google Cloud Endpoints
(GCE) project that serves those jokes, an Android Library containing an
activity for displaying jokes, and an Android app that fetches jokes from the
GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display.

## My note:

I tried to be as minimalist as I can in this project. So no progressBar or weird ads layers! Probably this is the easiest possible way to add a flavor to an android app.

I hope you enjoy it and by the way it is totally free to use in anyhow you like but has no warranty/guarantee.

cheers,
